**Today's Progress**: Learned how to add bootstrap 4 to an angular app using CLI, with some custom css color variables. Added bootstrap navbar and tested dropdown in mobile view.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying getting this portfolio site done even thou it was hard keeping one eye on the kids lout playing and the other trying concentrate on getting an hour of code in.
