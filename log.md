### Day 1: August 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Learned JS Fundamentals Udemy(Traversy Media) Started My Portfolio App in Angular10

### Day 2: August 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Learned how to add bootstrap 4 to an angular app using CLI, with some custom css color variables. Added bootstrap navbar and tested dropdown in mobile view.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying getting this portfolio site done even thou it was hard keeping one eye on the kids lout playing and the other trying concentrate on getting an hour of code in.

### Day 3: August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started to implement some new bootstrap css components such as a form and footer. I have added some TypeScript Variables and used Interpolation to display them on the page. I have added a new Date().getFullYear() to always display the current year within the footer. I am not sure about the color scheme just yet and may change it in the future.
I have continued JS Fundamentals Course refreshing on If Else statements.

**Thoughts:** Loving the progress on the Portfolio Site even thou I have been up since 4am to go to work. Then coming home to relieve the babysitter and playing and watching the kids while sneeking in some work on the site. Lookingh forward to tomorrow where I will have more free time to study and to code the website.
