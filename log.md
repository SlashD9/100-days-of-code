# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Learned JS Fundamentals Udemy(Traversy Media) Started My Portfolio App in Angular10

**Thoughts:** It was a good start, bit distracted with the kids but got a good bit done. Deployed my techdaly portfolio site on netlify and chnaged some stuff on my photography portfolio site.

**Link to work:** [TechDaly Website](https://techdaly.netlify.app)


### Day 2: August 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Learned how to add bootstrap 4 to an angular app using CLI, with some custom css color variables. Added bootstrap navbar and tested dropdown in mobile view.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying getting this portfolio site done even thou it was hard keeping one eye on the kids lout playing and the other trying concentrate on getting an hour of code in.

### Day 3: August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started to implement some new bootstrap css components such as a form and footer. I have added some TypeScript Variables and used Interpolation to display them on the page. I have added a new Date().getFullYear() to always display the current year within the footer. I am not sure about the color scheme just yet and may change it in the future. I also added routing to navbar.
I have continued JS Fundamentals Course refreshing on If Else statements.

**Thoughts:** Loving the progress on the Portfolio Site even thou I have been up since 4am to go to work. Then coming home to relieve the babysitter and playing and watching the kids while sneeking in some work on the site. Lookingh forward to tomorrow where I will have more free time to study and to code the website.

### Day 4: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started to add Owner and portfolios models. Added the portfolios service to the app but have not yet implemented.

**Thoughts:** Going back and forth with Angular Docs, Bootstrap Docs and Udemy, I have been able to add in the models and services and began to understand more about how they work.

### Day 5-6: August 16/17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued adding the portfolio service to the app and have aslo created data and dispayed it using a ngFor loop on the portfolios page, each portfolio has been set to display correctly on the page. I have also added my profile pictures to the app and changed image depending on size of screen. 

**Thoughts:** Continuing to understand more and more of how Angular works and really enjoying the process. I'm alot quicker coding than I first thought. I may continue adding more to techdaly app later today.

### Day 7: August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Reverted back to better learn Obervables using the Angular Udemy Course, copying for now and will then implement in my own project. Learning about the window object in JS Fundamentals, its all really starting to click in my into place...

**Thoughts:** It was hard to get motivated to do anything today, tuesdays are generally a struggle for me espescially getting up for 5 for work. Making alot of progress and everything is really starting to click into place, I find myself doing the code before the instructor tells me what to do. I'm just glad I go soemthing done today.

### Day 8: August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Follwed Tutorial to add RXJS Observable to my angular project, and to subscribe to it from another component through a service.
I'm Starting to think I may actually understand it somewhat.

**Thoughts:** Progress is happening, the encouragment based around coding on twitter is definitely helping keep me motivated. The 100daysofcode challenge is keeping me motivated. I struggle during the day trying to acheive any progress or sometimes just to get started but it is def worth it. I'm also listening to a book called the "The speed of trust" by Stephen Covey Jr, its encouraging and eye opening to the damages that lack of trust can have in your life. Its bringing up stuff from past employments, making me realise that it was a broken trust relationship that eventually ended the work relationship. Makes me strive even more to build trust with everyone in work and at home.
